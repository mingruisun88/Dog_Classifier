No. Alexnet and Resnet both reach the right class which is Great Dane. But VGG classify it wrong as bull mastiff.

4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer:
This is kind of a hard question. For the image I choose VGG did the worst with high run time and misclassification. Both Alexnet and Resnet get right answer with exactly the same runtime. I gonna to choose Resnet in this case though it have the same performance(runtime wise or accuracy wise) compare to Alexnet due to the fact that Resnet seems to have higher accuracy towards dog breeds. Our upload image testset was too small to show this difference.
